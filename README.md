👥 Team Roles
This project simulates a real-world software engineering team structure. Each role is responsible for critical components of the Airbnb Clone backend and its successful delivery.

🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the core business logic, designing and developing APIs (REST and GraphQL), and ensuring the backend integrates seamlessly with the database and other services. Backend developers also handle security, performance optimization, and unit testing.

🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs the relational schema and manages the database (MySQL). Ensures data integrity, optimizes query performance, handles backups, and enforces access control. Works closely with the backend team to align the database design with the application logic.

🔒 Security Engineer
Implements security protocols, including user authentication, authorization, input validation, and encryption. Reviews code for vulnerabilities and ensures that APIs and databases are protected from common threats (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF, XSS).

🚀 DevOps Engineer
Sets up and manages the CI/CD pipelines using Docker and GitHub Actions. Automates testing, deployment, and integration to streamline development. Ensures the application is containerized, reproducible, and scalable across environments.

🧾 Documentation Lead
Maintains clear and up-to-date project documentation using Markdown, including the README.md, API specs, database schema, setup guides, and development workflows. Ensures clarity, consistency, and accessibility for future contributors.

🧠 Project Lead / Architect
Oversees the technical direction and aligns architecture decisions with project goals. Coordinates between roles, supports blockers, and ensures adherence to timelines. Reviews pull requests, mentors team members, and ensures that all components integrate cohesively.

🧰 Technology Stack
Below is an overview of the technologies used in this Airbnb Clone backend project, along with their purpose:

🔹 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend application. It provides tools for rapid development, secure handling of data, and building RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF).

🔹 MySQL
A powerful open-source relational database management system used to store and manage structured data such as user profiles, listings, bookings, and reviews. It ensures data integrity and supports complex relationships.

🔹 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Used alongside REST to enable flexible and efficient client-server communication, especially useful for modern frontends.

🔹 Docker
A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into portable containers. Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

🔹 GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub, used to automate testing, linting, and deployment workflows. Ensures code quality and enables rapid delivery of new features and fixes.

🔹 Git & GitHub
Version control tools for managing code history, enabling collaboration, and tracking changes across multiple contributors. GitHub is also used to host the repository and manage issues, pull requests, and documentation.

🔹 Markdown
A lightweight markup language used for writing documentation, such as this README file, in a clean and readable format.

🗃️ Database Design
This project uses a relational database model to manage data integrity and relationships across various core entities. Below are the key entities, their main fields, and how they relate to one another.

1. User
Represents a person using the platform (host or guest).

id: Unique identifier

name: Full name of the user

email: Email address (unique)

password_hash: Encrypted password

is_host: Boolean indicating if the user can list properties

2. Property
Represents a listing that can be booked.

id: Unique identifier

title: Name/title of the property

description: Detailed info about the property

location: City or area

price_per_night: Cost of booking per night

owner_id: Foreign key to User (host)

3. Booking
Represents a reservation made by a user.

id: Unique identifier

user_id: Foreign key to User (guest)

property_id: Foreign key to Property

start_date: Check-in date

end_date: Check-out date

status: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

4. Review
Represents feedback left by a guest after a stay.

id: Unique identifier

user_id: Foreign key to User (reviewer)

property_id: Foreign key to Property

rating: Star rating (e.g., 1–5)

comment: Text feedback

5. Payment
Represents a payment transaction for a booking.

id: Unique identifier

booking_id: Foreign key to Booking

amount: Total amount paid

payment_method: Card, PayPal, etc.

payment_status: Success, failed, pending

🔗 Entity Relationships
A User can be a host (owns properties) or a guest (books properties).

A User can have many Properties (if they are a host).

A User can make many Bookings (as a guest).

A Booking belongs to one User and one Property.

A Property can have many Bookings and many Reviews.

A Review is linked to both the Property and the User who wrote it.

A Payment is tied to a single Booking.

🧩 Feature Breakdown
Below are the main features implemented in the backend of the Airbnb Clone project. Each feature contributes to the functionality and user experience of the booking platform.

🔐 User Management
Enables user registration, login, authentication, and profile updates. Distinguishes between guests and hosts, with role-based access to relevant features (e.g., property listing for hosts, booking for guests).

🏠 Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details like title, description, location, photos, and pricing — ensuring hosts can showcase their properties effectively.

📅 Booking System
Handles the reservation process for guests. Users can check availability, make bookings, and view booking history. This feature ensures that dates are managed accurately and prevents double-booking.

💳 Payment Integration
Processes payments securely for confirmed bookings. Tracks transaction status, amount, and method to provide a reliable record for both the guest and platform.

⭐ Review System
Enables guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after a stay. Reviews enhance trust and help future users make informed booking decisions.

🔍 Search and Filter
Supports property search by location, availability, price range, and other filters. Improves the discoverability of listings and enhances the user browsing experience.

🛡️ Security and Authentication
Implements user authentication (e.g., JWT), password hashing, and authorization layers. Ensures that sensitive data is protected and only authorized users can access specific actions.

🔄 API & CI/CD Automation
RESTful and GraphQL APIs provide structured communication between frontend and backend. Automated CI/CD pipelines (via GitHub Actions and Docker) ensure reliable deployments and code quality.

5. API Security Overview
mandatory
Objective: Understand the importance of securing the backend APIs.

Instructions:

In your README.md file, create a section called “API Security”.

Explain the key security measures that will be implemented (e.g., authentication, authorization, rate limiting).

Provide a brief explanation of why security is crucial for each key area of the project (e.g., protecting user data, securing payments, etc.).

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
