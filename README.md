# airbnb-clone-project
Airbnb Clone Project
📌 Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of Airbnb, designed to simulate the development of a real-world booking platform. It focuses on building a scalable and secure backend system that supports core Airbnb functionalities such as property listings, reservations, user accounts, and more.

The goal is to master backend architecture, collaborative development workflows, and CI/CD best practices, while deepening understanding of how complex applications are structured and maintained in production environments.

🎯 Project Goals
Build a scalable and secure backend system.

Apply best practices in GitHub collaboration and version control.

Design and implement a relational database schema.

Develop RESTful and GraphQL APIs to handle business logic and user interaction.

Integrate security and authentication measures.

Set up CI/CD pipelines using Docker and GitHub Actions.

Deliver professional, well-documented code and team planning artifacts.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Django

Database: MySQL

API Technologies: REST, GraphQL

CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker

Version Control & Collaboration: Git, GitHub

Documentation: Markdown

👥 Team Roles
This project simulates a real-world software engineering team structure. Each role is responsible for critical components of the Airbnb Clone backend and its successful delivery.

🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the core business logic, designing and developing APIs (REST and GraphQL), and ensuring the backend integrates seamlessly with the database and other services. Backend developers also handle security, performance optimization, and unit testing.

🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs the relational schema and manages the database (MySQL). Ensures data integrity, optimizes query performance, handles backups, and enforces access control. Works closely with the backend team to align the database design with the application logic.

🔒 Security Engineer
Implements security protocols, including user authentication, authorization, input validation, and encryption. Reviews code for vulnerabilities and ensures that APIs and databases are protected from common threats (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF, XSS).

🚀 DevOps Engineer
Sets up and manages the CI/CD pipelines using Docker and GitHub Actions. Automates testing, deployment, and integration to streamline development. Ensures the application is containerized, reproducible, and scalable across environments.

🧾 Documentation Lead
Maintains clear and up-to-date project documentation using Markdown, including the README.md, API specs, database schema, setup guides, and development workflows. Ensures clarity, consistency, and accessibility for future contributors.

🧠 Project Lead / Architect
Oversees the technical direction and aligns architecture decisions with project goals. Coordinates between roles, supports blockers, and ensures adherence to timelines. Reviews pull requests, mentors team members, and ensures that all components integrate cohesively.
